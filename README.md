<h3> The Odin Project Foundations PROJECT: RECIPES</h3>
<p>In this project I will demonstrate the knowledge acquired during the HTML Foundation course of The Odin project.</p>
<p><strong><em>For this end, I will build a basic recipe website using only HTML.</em></strong></p>
<p>I made a main index page that links to different webpages that contain recipes.</p>
<p>Each page has different heading sizes, paragraphs of text, unordered and ordered lists as well as images that are contained within the site.</p>
<p> you can access the site <a href="https://rhas92.github.io/odin-recipes/">using this link</a> </p>
